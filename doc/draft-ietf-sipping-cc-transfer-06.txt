1.  Overview

   This document describes providing Call Transfer capabilities and
   requirements in SIP [1].  This work is part of the Multiparty Call
   Control Framework [6].

   The mechanisms discussed here are most closely related to traditional
   basic and consultation hold transfers.

   This document details the use of REFER method [2] and Replaces [3]
   header field to achieve call transfer.

   A user agent that fully supports the transfer mechanisms described in
   this document MUST support REFER[2] and Replaces[3] in addition to
   RFC 3261 [1].  A user agent should use a Contact URI which meets the
   requirements in Section 8.1.1.8 of RFC 3261.  A user agent SHOULD
   support the Target-Dialog header field [5].


2.  Actors and Roles

   There are three actors in a given transfer event, each playing one of
   the following roles:

     Transferee -      the party being transferred to the Transfer
                       Target.

     Transferor -      the party initiating the transfer

     Transfer Target - the new party being introduced into a
                       call with the Transferee.

   The following roles are used to describe transfer requirements and
   scenarios:

















Sparks, et al.          Expires September 6, 2006               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               SIP CC Transfer                  March 2006


      Originator -  wishes to place a call to the Recipient. This
                    actor is the source of the first INVITE in a
                    session, to either a Facilitator or a Screener.

      Facilitator - receives a call or out-of-band request from the
                    Originator, establishes a call to the Recipient
                    through the Screener, and connects the
                    Originator to the Recipient.

      Screener -    receives a call ultimately intended for the
                    Recipient and transfers the calling party to
                    the Recipient if appropriate.

      Recipient -   the party the Originator is ultimately
                    connected to.


3.  Requirements

   1.  Any party in a SIP session MUST be able to transfer any other
       party in that session at any point in that session.
   2.  The Transferor and the Transferee MUST NOT be removed from a
       session as part of a transfer transaction.

             At first glance, requirement 2 may seem to indicate
             that the user experience in a transfer must be
             significantly different from what a current PBX or
             Centrex user expects. As the call-flows in this
             document show, this is not the case. A client MAY
             preserve the current experience. In fact, without
             this requirement, some forms of the current
             experience (ringback on transfer failure
             for instance) will be lost.

   3.  The Transferor MUST know whether or not the transfer was
       successful.
   4.  The Transferee MUST be able to replace an existing dialog with a
       new dialog.
   5.  The Transferor and Transferee SHOULD indicate their support for
       the primitives required to achieve transfer.
   6.  The Transferor SHOULD provide the Transfer Target and Transferee
       with information about the nature and progress of the transfer
       operation being attempted.


             To meet this requirement, the transfer operation can
             be modeled as an ad-hoc conference between three
             parties, as discussed in Section 8.

4.  Using REFER to achieve Call Transfer

   A REFER [2] can be issued by the Transferor to cause the Transferee
   to issue an INVITE to the Transfer-Target.  Note that a successful
   REFER transaction does not terminate the session between the
   Transferor and the Transferee.  If those parties wish to terminate
   their session, they must do so with a subsequent BYE request.  The
   media negotiated between the transferee and the transfer target is
   not affected by the media that had been negotiated between the
   transferor and the transferee.  In particular, the INVITE issued by
   the Transferee will have the same SDP body it would have if he
   Transferee had initiated that INVITE on its own.  Further, the
   disposition of the media streams between the Transferor and the
   Transferee is not altered by the REFER method.

   Agents may alter a session's media through additional signaling.  For
   example, they may make use of the SIP hold re-INVITE [1] or
   conferencing extensions described in the conferencing framework [9].

   To perform the transfer, the transferor and transferee could reuse an
   existing dialog established by an INVITE to send the REFER.  This
   would result in a single dialog shared by two uses - an invite usage
   and a subscription usage.  The call flows for this are shown in
   detail in Section 5.2.  However, the approach described in this
   document is to avoid dialog reuse.  The issues and difficulties
   associated with dialog reuse are described in [12].

   Motivations for reusing the existing dialog include:
   1.  There was no way to ensure that a REFER on a new dialog would
       reach the particular endpoint involved in a transfer.  Many
       factors, including details of implementations and changes in
       proxy routing between an INVITE and a REFER could cause the REFER
       to be sent to the wrong place.  Sending the REFER down the
       existing dialog ensured it got to the endpoint we were already
       talking to.
   2.  It was unclear how to associate an existing invite usage with a
       REFER arriving on a new dialog, where it was completely obvious
       what the association was when the REFER came on the invite
       usage's dialog.
   3.  There were concerns with authorizing out-of-dialog REFERs.  The
       authorization policy for REFER in most implementations piggybacks
       on the authorization policy for INVITE (which is, in most cases,
       based simply on "I placed or answered this call").

   GRUUs [7] can be used to address problem 1.  Problem 2 can be
   addressed using the Target-Dialog header field defined in [5].  In
   the immediate term, this solution to problem 2 allows the existing
   REFER authorization policy to be reused.

   As a result, if the Transferee supports the target-dialog extension
   and the Transferor knows the Contact URI is routable outside the
   dialog, the REFER SHOULD be sent in a new dialog.  If the nature of
   the Contact URI is not known or if support for the target-dialog
   extension is not known, the REFER should be sent inside the existing
   dialog.  A Transferee must be prepared to receive a REFER either
   inside or outside a dialog.  One way that a Transferor could know
   that a Contact URI is routable outside a dialog is by validation
   (e.g. sending an OPTIONS and receiving a response) or if it satisfies
   the properties described in the GRUU specification [7].

   In most of the following examples, the Transferor is in the
   atlanta.example.com domain, the Transferee is in the
   biloxi.example.com, and the Transfer Target is in the
   chicago.example.com domain.


5.  Basic Transfer

   Basic Transfer consists of the Transferor providing the Transfer
   Target's contact to the Transferee.  The Transferee attempts to
   establish a session using that contact and reports the results of
   that attempt to the Transferor.  The signaling relationship between
   the Transferor and Transferee is not terminated, so the call is
   recoverable if the Transfer Target cannot be reached.  Note that the
   Transfer Target's contact information has been exposed to the
   Transferee.  The provided contact can be used to make new calls in
   the future.

   The participants in a basic transfer should indicate support for the
   REFER and NOTIFY methods in Allow header fields in INVITE, 200 OK to
   INVITE, and OPTIONS messages.

   The diagrams below show the first line of each message.  The first
   column of the figure shows the dialog used in that particular
   message.  In these diagrams, media is managed through re-INVITE
   holds, but other mechanisms (mixing multiple media streams at the UA
   or using the conferencing extensions for example) are valid.
   Selected message details are shown labeled as message F1, F2, etc.

   Each of the flows below shows the dialog between the Transferor and
   the Transferee remaining connected (on hold) during the REFER
   process.  While this provides the greatest flexibility for recovery
   from failure, it is not necessary.  If the Transferor's agent does
   not wish to participate in the remainder of the REFER process and has
   no intention of assisting with recovery from transfer failure, it
   could emit a BYE to the Transferee as soon as the REFER transaction
   completes.  This flow is sometimes known as "unattended transfer" or

   "blind transfer".

   Figure 1 shows transfer when the Transferee utilizes a GRUU and
   supports the target-dialog extension and indicates this to the
   Transferor.  As a result, the Transferor sends the REFER outside the
   INVITE dialog.  The Transferee is able to match this REFER to the
   existing dialog using the Target-Dialog header field in the refer
   which references the existing dialog.

5.2.  Transfer with Dialog Reuse

   In this scenario, the Transferor does not know the properties of the
   Transferee's Contact URI or does not know that the Transferee
   supports the Target-Dialog header field.  As a result, the REFER is
   sent inside the INVITE dialog.

6.  Transfer with Consultation Hold

   Transfer with Consultation Hold involves a session between the
   transferor and the transfer target before the transfer actually takes
   place.  This is implemented with SIP Hold and Transfer as described
   above.

   A nice feature is for the transferor to let the target know that the
   session relates to an intended transfer.  Since many UAs render the
   display name in the From header field to the user, a consultation
   INVITE could contain a string such as "Incoming consultation from
   Transferor with intent to transfer Transferee", where the display
   names of the transferor and transferee are included in the string.

6.1.  Exposing transfer target

   The transferor places the transferee on hold, establishes a call with
   the transfer target to alert them to the impending transfer,
   terminates the connection with the transfer target, then proceeds
   with transfer as above.  This variation can be used to provide an
   experience similar to that expected by current PBX and Centrex users.

   To (hopefully) improve clarity, non-REFER transactions have been
   collapsed into one indicator with the arrow showing the direction of
   the request.

6.2.  Protecting transfer target

   The transferor places the transferee on hold, establishes a call with
   the transfer target and then reverses their roles, transferring the
   original transfer target to the original transferee.  This has the
   advantage of hiding information about the original transfer target
   from the original transferee.  On the other hand, the Transferee's
   experience is different that in current systems.  The Transferee is
   effectively "called back" by the Transfer Target.

   One of the problems with this simplest implementation of a target
   protecting transfer is that the transferee is receiving a new call
   from the transfer-target.  Unless the transferee's agent has a
   reliable way to associate this new call with the call it already has
   with the transferor, it will have to alert the new call on another

   appearance.  If this, or some other call-waiting-like UI were not
   available, the transferee might be stuck returning a Busy-Here to the
   transfer target, effectively preventing the transfer.  There are many
   ways that that correlation could be provided.  The dialog parameters
   could be provided directly as header parameters in the Refer-To: URI
   for example.  The Replaces mechanism [3] uses this approach and
   solves this problem nicely.

   For the flow below, dialog1 means dialog identifier 1, and consists
   of the parameters of the Replaces header for dialog 1.  In [3] this
   is the Call-ID, To-tag and From-tag.

   Note that the transferee's agent emits a BYE to the transferor's
   agent as an immediate consequence of processing the Replaces header.

   The Transferor knows that both the Transferee and the Transfer Target
   support the Replaces header from the Supported: replaces header
   contained in the 200 OK responses from both.

   In this scenario, the Transferee utilizes a GRUU as a Contact URI for
   reasons discussed in Section 6.3.

   Note that the conventions used in the SIP Torture Test Messages [8]
   document are reused, specifically the <allOneLine> tag.

6.3.  Attended Transfer

   The transferor places the transferee on hold, establishes a call with
   the transfer target to alert them to the impending transfer, places
   the target on hold, then proceeds with transfer using an escaped
   Replaces header field in the Refer-To header.  This is another common
   service expected by current PBX and Centrex users.

   The Contact URI of the Transfer Target SHOULD be used by the
   Transferee as the Refer-To URI, unless the URI is suspected or known
   to not be routable outside the dialog.  Otherwise, the Address of
   Record (AOR) of the Transfer Target should be used.  That is, the
   same URI that the Transferee used to establish the session with the
   Transfer Target should be used.  In case the triggered INVITE is
   routed to a different User Agent than the Transfer Target, the
   Require: replaces header field should be used in the triggered
   INVITE.  (This is to prevent an incorrect User Agent which does not
   support Replaces from ignoring the Replaces and answering the INVITE
   without a dialog match.)

   It is possible that proxy/service routing may prevent the triggered
   INVITE from reaching the same User Agent.  If this occurs, the
   triggered invite will fail with a timout, 403, 404, etc error.  The
   Transferee MAY then retry the transfer with the Refer-To URI set to
   the Contact URI.

6.4.  Recovery when one party does not support REFER

   If protecting or exposing the transfer target is not a concern, it is
   possible to complete a transfer with consultation hold when only the
   transferor and one other party support REFER.  Note that a 405 Method
   Not Allowed might be returned instead of the 501 Not Implemented
   response.

6.5.  Attended transfer when Contact URI is not known to route to a
      unique user agent.

   It is a requirement of RFC3261 that a Contact URI be globally
   routable even outside the dialog.  However, due to RFC2543 User
   Agents and some architectures (NAT/Firewall traversal, screening
   proxies, ALGs, etc.) this will not always be the case.  As a result,
   the method of Attended Transfer shown in Figures 6, 7, and 8 should
   only be used if the Contact URI is known to be routable outside the

   dialog.

   Figure 9 shows such a scenario where the Transfer Target Contact URI
   is not routable outside the dialog, so the triggered INVITE is sent
   to the AOR of the Transfer Target.

   Figure 10 shows a failure case in which the AOR URI fails to reach
   the transfer Target.  As a result, the transfer is retried with the
   Contact URI which succeeds.

   Note that there is still no guarantee that the correct endpoint will
   be reached, and the result of this second REFER may also be a
   failure.  In that case, the Transferor could fall back to unattended
   transfer or give up on the transfer entirely.  Since two REFERs are
   sent within the dialog creating two distinct subscriptions, the
   Transferee uses the 'id' parameter in the Event header field to
   distinguish notifications for the two subscriptions.

   To prevent this scenario from happening, the Transfer Target should
   use a Contact URI which is routable outside the dialog, which will
   result in the call flow of Figure 7.

6.6.  Semi-Attended Transfer

   In any of the consultation hold flows above, the Transferor may
   decide to terminate its attempt to contact the Transfer target before
   that session is established.  Most frequently, that will be the end
   of the scenario, but in some circumstances, the transferor may wish
   to proceed with the transfer action.  For example, the Transferor may
   wish to complete the transfer knowing that the transferee will end up
   eventually talking to the transfer-target's voice-mail service.  Some
   PBX systems support this feature, sometimes called "semi-attended
   transfer", that is effectively a hybrid between a fully attended
   transfer and an unattended transfer.  A call flow is shown in Figure
   11.  In this flow, the Transferor's User Agent continues the transfer

   as an attended transfer even after the Transferor hangs up.  Note
   that media must be played to the Transfer Target upon answer -
   otherwise, the Target may hang up and the resulting transfer
   operation will fail.

   Figure 11.  Recommended Semi-Attended Transfer Call Flow.

   Two other possible semi-attended transfer call flows are shown in
   Figures 12 and 13.  However, these call flows are NOT RECOMMENDED due
   to a race conditions.  In both of these flows, when the Transferor
   hangs up, the User Agent attempts to revert to unattended transfer by
   sending a CANCEL to the Target.  This can result in two race
   conditions.  One is that the Target answers despite the CANCEL and
   the resulting unattended transfer fails.  This race condition can be
   eliminated by the Transferor waiting to send the REFER until the 487
   response from the Target is returned.  Instead of a 487, a 200 OK may
   return indicating that the Target has answered the consultation call.
   In this, case the call flow in Figure 13 must be followed.  In this
   flow, the Transferor must play some kind of media to the Target to
   prevent the Target from hanging up, or the Transfer will fail.  That
   is, the human at the Transfer Target will hear silence from when they
   answer (message F1) until the transfer completes (F3 and they are
   talking to the Transferee unless some media is played (F2).

   The second race condition occurs in Figure 12 if the Transfer Target
   goes "off hook" after the CANCEL is received and the 487 returned.
   This may result in a 486 Busy Here response to the unattended
   transfer.

   The recommended call flow of Figure 11 does not utilize a CANCEL and
   does not suffer from these race conditions.

6.7.  Attended Transfer Fallback to Basic Transfer

   In this flow, an attempted attended transfer fails so the transferor
   falls back to basic transfer.

   The call flow in Figure 14 shows the use of Require:replaces in the
   INVITE sent by the Transferor to the Transfer Target in which the
   Transferor's intention at the time of sending the INVITE to the
   Transfer Target was known to be to complet an attended transfer.
   Since the Target does not support Replaces, the INVITE is rejected
   with a 420 Bad Extension response, and the Transferor switches from
   attended transfer to basic transfer immediately.

   Figure 14.  Attended Transfer Fallback to Basic Transfer using
   Require:replaces.

   Figure 13 shows the use of OPTIONS when the Transferee and Transfer
   Target do not explicitly indicate support for the REFER method and
   Replaces header fields in Allow and Supported header fields and the
   Transferor did not have the intention of performing an attended
   transfer when the INVITE to the Target was sent.  In dialog1, the
   Transferor determines using OPTIONS that the Transferee does support
   REFER and Replaces.  As a result, the Transferor begins the attended
   transfer by placing the Transferee on hold and calling the Transfer
   Target.  Using an OPTIONS in dialog2, the Transferor determines that
   the Target does not support either REFER or Replaces, making attended
   transfer impossible.  The Transferor then ends dialog2 by sending a
   BYE then sends a REFER to the Transferee using the AOR URI of the
   Transfer Target.

7.  Transfer with Referred-By

   In the previous examples, the Transfer Target does not have
   definitive information about what party initiated the transfer, or,
   in some cases, even that transfer is taking place.  The Referred-By
   mechanism [4] provides a way for the Transferor to provide the
   Transferee with a way to let the Transfer Target know what party
   initiated the transfer.

   The simplest and least secure approach just involves the inclusion of

   the Referred-By header field in the REFER which is then copied into
   the triggered INVITE.  However, a more secure mechanism involving the
   Referred-By security token which is generated and signed by the
   Transferor and passed in a message body to the Transferee then to the
   Transfer Target.

   The call flow would be identical to Figure 7.  However, the REFER and
   triggered INVITE messages for this flow showing the Referred-By
   mechanism are shown below.

8.  Transfer as an Ad-Hoc Conference

   In this flow, Bob does an attended transfer of Alice to Carol.  In
   order to keep both Alice and Carol fully informed of the nature and
   state of the transfer operation, Bob acts as a focus[10] and hosts an
   ad-hoc conference involving Alice, Bob, and Carol.  Alice and Carol
   subscribe to the conference package[11] of Bob's focus, which allows
   them to know the exact status of the operation.  After the transfer
   operation is complete, Bob deletes the conference.

   This call flow meets requirement 6 of Section 3.  NOTIFY messages
   related to the refer package are indicated as NOTIFY (refer), while
   NOTIFYs related to the Conference Info package are indicated as
   NOTIFY (Conf-Info).

   Note that any type of semi-attended transfer in which media mixing or
   relaying could be implemented using this model.  In addition to
   simply mixing, the focus could introduce additional media signals
   such as simulated ring tone or on hold announcements to improve the
   user experience.

   In this example the Originator places call to the Facilitator who
   reaches the Recipient through the Screener.  The Recipient's contact
   information is exposed to the Facilitator and the Originator.  This
   example is provided for clarification of the semantics of the REFER
   method only and should not be used as the design of an
   implementation.

10.  Gateway Transfer Issues

   A gateway in SIP acts as a User Agent.  As a result, the entire
   preceding discussion and call flows apply equally well to gateways as
   native SIP endpoints.  However, there are some gateway specific
   issues that are documented in this section.  While this discussion
   focuses on the common cases involving PSTN gateways, similar
   situations exist for other gateways, such as H.323/SIP gateways.

10.1.  Coerce Gateway Hairpins to the Same Gateway

   To illustrate how a hairpin situation can occur in transfer, consider
   this example.  The original call dialog is setup with the transferee
   residing on the PSTN side of a SIP gateway.  The transferor is a SIP
   phone purely in the IP space.  The transfer target is on the PSTN
   side of a SIP gateway as well.  After completing the transfer,
   (regardless of consultative or blind) the transferee is in a call
   with the transfer target (both on the PSTN side of a gateway).  It is
   often desirable to remove the gateway(s) out of the loop.  This is
   likely to only be possible if both legs of the target call are on the
   same gateway.  With both legs on the same gateway, it may be able to
   invoke the analogous transfer on the PSTN side.  Then the target call
   would not involve the gateway.

   So the problem is how to give the proxy enough information so that it
   knows to route the call to the same gateway.  With a simple single
   call that hairpins, the incoming and outgoing leg have the same
   dialog.  The proxy should have enough information to optimize the
   routing.

   In the consultative transfer scenario, it is desirable to coerce the
   consultative INVITE out the same gateway as the original call to be
   transferred.  However there is no way to relate the consultation with
   the original call.  In the consultative case the target call INVITE
   includes the Replaces header which contains dialog information that
   can be used to relate it to the consultation.  However there is no
   information that relates the target call to the original.

Internet-Draft               SIP CC Transfer                  March 2006


   In the blind transfer scenario, it is desirable to coerce the target
   call onto the same gateway as the original call.  However the same
   problem exists in that the target dialog cannot be related to the
   original dialog.

   In either transfer scenario, it may be desirable to push the transfer
   operation onto the non-SIP side of the gateway.  Presumably this is
   not possible unless all of the legs go out the same gateway.  If the
   gateway supports more than one truck group, it might also be
   necessary to get all of the legs on the same trunk group in order to
   perform the transfer on the non-SIP side of the gateway.

   Solutions to these gateway specific issues may involve new extensions
   to SIP in the future.

10.2.  Consultative Turned Blind Gateway Glare

   In the consultative transfer case turned blind, there is a glare-like
   problem.  The transferor initiates the consultation INVITE, the user
   gets impatient and hangs up, transitioning this to a blind transfer.
   The transfer target on the gateway (connected through a PSTN switch
   to a single line or dumb analog phone) rings.  The user answers the
   phone just after the CANCEL is received by the transfer target.  The
   REFER and INVITE for the target call are sent.  The transferee
   attempts to setup the call on the PSTN side, but gets either a busy
   or lands in the users voicemail as the user has the handset in hand
   and off hook.

   This is another example of a race condition that this call flow can
   cause.  The recommended behavior is to use the approach described in
   Section 6.6.


11.  IANA Considerations

   None.


12.  Security Considerations

   The call transfer flows shown in this document are implemented using
   the REFER and Replaces call control primitives in SIP.  As such, the
   attacks and security approaches are those detailed in the REFER and
   Replaces documents which are briefly summarized in the following
   paragraphs.  This document addresses the issue of protecting the
   Address of Record URI of a transfer target in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

   Any REFER request must be appropriately authenticated and authorized

   using standard SIP mechanisms or calls may be hijacked.  A user agent
   may use local policy or human intervention in deciding whether or not
   to accept a REFER.  In generating NOTIFY responses based on the
   outcome of the triggered request, care should be taken in
   constructing the message/sipfrag body to ensure that no private
   information is leaked.

   An INVITE containing a Replaces header field should only be accepted
   if it has been properly authenticated and authorized using standard
   SIP mechanisms, and the requestor is authorized to perform dialog
   replacement.
